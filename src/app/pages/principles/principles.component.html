      <p>At Librevore Village, we are guided by a set of core principles that form the foundation of our community. These principles inform our decision-making, shape our daily interactions, and create the framework for how we live together.</p>

        <h2>Voluntaryism</h2>
        <p>We believe that all human interactions should be voluntary, free from coercion, threats, or violence. Our community operates on the principle that individuals have the right to make their own choices as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of others.</p>
        
        <h3>In Practice:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Community decisions are made through consensus or voluntary agreement rather than majority rule</li>
          <li>Members are free to participate in community activities as they choose</li>
          <li>Dispute resolution is based on peaceful negotiation and mediation</li>
          <li>Individual boundaries and property rights are respected</li>
          <li>All contributions to community projects are voluntary</li>
        </ul>
